## Design Philosophy and Approach

When approaching this challenge, I focused on creating a robust, maintainable API that effectively transforms unstructured menu data into a well-organized GraphQL schema. My primary goals were:

1. **Data Structure Integrity**: Preserving the hierarchical nature of restaurant menu data while making it easily queryable
2. **Developer Experience**: Creating intuitive GraphQL queries that mirror how developers would naturally think about menu data
3. **Parsing Robustness**: Building a parser that could handle the irregularities and edge cases in the provided menu text

## Key Technical Decisions

### Data Parsing Strategy

The core of this implementation is the `parseMenu` function in `menuDataUtilities.js`. I designed this function to handle several complexities in the raw menu data:

- **Category and subcategory detection**: The parser identifies category headers (like "-APPETIZERS-") and subcategories (like "HOT" and "COLD" under SANDWICHES)
- **Price extraction**: Menu items have prices typically at the end of the line, which the parser extracts and converts to numeric values
- **Item variations**: Some items (like sandwiches) have multiple price points based on size or type. The parser intelligently groups these as variations of a single item
- **Description separation**: The parser separates item names from descriptions, typically split by a dash or other delimiter
- **Special notes**: Category-specific information (like "Served with choice of...") is preserved as notes attached to the category

This approach transforms plain text into a rich, hierarchical data structure that preserves all the nuances of the original menu while making it programmatically accessible.

### GraphQL Schema Design

The GraphQL schema was designed to mirror the natural hierarchy of restaurant menus:

- **Categories** contain items and may contain subcategories
- **Subcategories** contain their own set of items
- **MenuItems** have properties like name, description, and price, and may have variations
- **MenuItemVariations** represent different pricing options for the same item

This design allows clients to request exactly the data they need, whether that's a high-level overview of categories or detailed information about specific items.

### ID Strategy

I implemented a consistent ID strategy that encodes hierarchical relationships:
- Category IDs are numeric (e.g., "1" for APPETIZERS)
- Subcategory IDs include their parent category (e.g., "3-sub-1" for COLD under SANDWICHES)
- Item IDs include their category or subcategory context (e.g., "3-COLD-1" for an item in the COLD subcategory)
- Variation IDs include their parent item (e.g., "3-COLD-1-var-1" for a variation of an item)

This approach makes IDs meaningful and helps maintain relationships between different entities in the menu structure.

### Resolver Implementation

The resolvers were designed to:
- Provide efficient access to categories, items, and relationships between them
- Support useful query patterns like searching and filtering
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Ensure related entities can be easily accessed (e.g., getting a menu item's category)

### Testing Strategy

The tests focus on verifying:
- The overall structure of the data model
- The correctness of the parsing logic
- The functionality of each query type
- The relationships between different entities

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Inconsistent Menu Formatting

The raw menu data used varied formats for separating names and descriptions (sometimes using "â€“", other times "-") and had inconsistent spacing.

**Solution**: The parser uses multiple separator detection strategies and falls back to intelligent word-based splitting when explicit separators aren't found.

### Challenge: Complex Pricing Models

Some menu items have multiple price points based on variants (e.g., "half sandwich" vs "full sandwich").

**Solution**: I implemented a variation system that groups these related items together, maintaining the relationship while preserving the distinct pricing.

### Challenge: Categories with Special Structure

SANDWICHES and ENCHILADAS categories had special structures with subcategories or variant pricing.

**Solution**: The data model was designed to be flexible, allowing categories to optionally have subcategories, notes, and direct items.

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation satisfies the requirements, several enhancements could be made:

1. **Database Integration**: Replace in-memory storage with a database for persistence
2. **Mutation Support**: Add GraphQL mutations for menu management (add/edit/delete items)
3. **Input Validation**: Add more robust validation for GraphQL inputs
4. **Caching**: Implement response caching to improve performance
5. **Authentication**: Add user authentication for protected operations
6. **Pagination**: Add support for paginated queries when dealing with large menus
7. **Image Support**: Extend the schema to support menu item images
8. **Allergen Information**: Add support for dietary and allergen information
